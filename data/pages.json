This time is to commend the work of all humanitarian workers who dedicate their professional lives to helping the needy and those affected by the war for the ninth consecutive year. According to UN statistics, the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance in Yemen this year has reached 21 million. Year after year, the Yemeni humanitarian community struggles to reach the level of challenges posed by the expansion of humanitarian operations despite the existing obstacles. The determination and dedication of humanitarian workers enable them to reach the most difficult and dangerous places to carry out their mission and implement their interventions. On World Humanitarian Day, it is important to highlight that humanitarian work may be one of the few threads, if not the only thread, that unites humanity in its agreement on its importance. Humanitarian work has become the lifeline extended to any nation during times of escalating crises, halted life domains, and dysfunctional governments. Therefore, it is incumbent upon everyone to cooperate, collaborate, and move forward in facilitating and implementing humanitarian work to include all individuals affected by the war in all governorates of the republic as much as possible.",

Ta’izz, Yemen – January 4, 2024 (BCFHD) in partnership with Oxfam launched a cash for work program in AL-Maafer and Maqbanah districts of Ta’izz governorate, funded by the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. The program is part of the “Building Resilience Through Integrated Community-Based and Humanitarian Systems Transformation and Leadership in Yemen” project. The program aims to support the poorest families in the two districts by providing them with temporary employment opportunities that enable them to meet their basic needs. This will be done through their participation in the rehabilitation and paving of rough roads, which are the main and only artery for the movement of citizens between different villages and markets in the targeted areas. During the launch, Mr. Sami Al-Duba’i, the project manager, said: “We are pleased to launch this important project, given the positive impact it will have on improving the difficult living conditions of the targeted communities that lack the most basic necessities of life in light of the ongoing war and recurring natural disasters. This project reflects our commitment to supporting local communities affected by the war in Yemen.”",

      "content": "Bena Charity Celebrates World Environment Day. Bena Charity celebrated World Environment Day this morning with the attendance of Secretary-General Mr. Tawfiq Abdul-Khabir, Executive Director Mr. Tariq Al-Hamadi, Head of the Environment and Climate Department Mr. Naseem Al-Muslimi, and BCFHD’s employees. Mr. Badri Al-Ibi, Director of the General Directorate of Environment and Climate in Taiz Governorate, stated that World Environment Day is a day led by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) since 1973. World Environment Day is a global platform for raising public awareness about all aspects and issues of the natural and urban environment. Al-Ibi stressed that the global environment today is suffering from many issues, the most important of which are global warming and climate change, pollution of seas and oceans, air pollution, and increased pollution with waste, especially plastic waste, including pollution with chemicals and sewage waste. Al-Ibi noted that the deterioration of ecosystems and their biological components is a result of overexploitation and multiple pressures to increase the population, as well as a lack of a broad vision in protecting ecosystems, preserving biodiversity, and using them sustainably; which directly and indirectly affects the well-being of the population and economic development at the level of the globe. Mr. Tawfiq Abdul-Khabir, Secretary-General of Build Charity, affirmed the importance of preserving the environment, stressing that it is “an ethical and human responsibility that falls on everyone’s shoulders.” He pointed out that “the environmental challenges facing our planet require us to make more efforts to conserve natural resources and ensure a better future for future generations.” Abdul-Khabir explained that BCFHD “puts environmental protection at the top of its priorities.” He added, “We are working to implement many programs and projects that aim to spread environmental awareness, support sustainable practices, and strengthen cooperation between various stakeholders to protect the environment.” For his part, Mr. Naseem Al-Muslimi, Head of the Environment and Climate Department at BCFHD, affirmed BCFHD’s “commitment to providing technical and technical support to local communities to help protect the environment.” He pointed out that “BCFHD is working to develop programs that enhance and aim at the importance of preserving the environment.” This celebration comes as a confirmation of BCFHD’s commitment to protecting the environment and promoting sustainable development. BCFHD calls on all members of society to cooperate together to preserve our planet for future generations.",

The Importance of Building Schools in Remote Areas: – Breaking the Cycle of Poverty: Education is an effective tool for breaking the cycle of poverty, as it empowers individuals to acquire the skills and knowledge needed to obtain better job opportunities and improve their living standards. – Promoting Community Development: Schools play a vital role in promoting community development by providing a safe and stimulating learning environment that contributes to the development of individuals’ skills and abilities, and helps prepare a conscious generation capable of contributing to the building of their community. – Reducing Dropout Rates: Schools located close to students’ homes help reduce dropout rates, especially among girls, allowing them to access better education and helping improve their lives. – Integrating Everyone into the Educational Process: Schools in remote areas ensure that all children, regardless of their background or place of residence, have access to quality education, which contributes to achieving the principle of equal opportunities. – Preparing an Educated Generation: Schools in remote areas contribute to the preparation of an educated generation capable of keeping pace with scientific and technological developments and effectively participating in building the renaissance of their country.

The date of 28 July was chosen because it is the birthday of Nobel-prize winning scientist Dr Baruch Blumberg, who discovered hepatitis B virus (HBV) and developed a diagnostic test and vaccine for the virus. Low coverage of testing and treatment is the most important gap to be addressed in order to achieve the global elimination goals by 2030.",

Digitalization is transforming our world, offering unprecedented opportunities to accelerate sustainable development. Digital technologies such as mobile devices, services, and artificial intelligence are instrumental in advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

With profound impact across economic, social and environmental dimensions, digital technologies and data contribute to at least 70 per cent of the 169 SDG targets while potentially reducing the cost of achieving these goals by up to USD 55 trillion. Young people are leading the charge in digital adoption and innovation, with three-quarters of those aged 15 to 24 using the internet in 2022, a rate higher than other age groups. However, disparities persist, particularly in low-income countries and among young women, who often have less access to the internet and digital skills compared to their male counterparts. While there is an urgent need to enhance digital inclusion, youth are largely recognized as “digital natives,” using technology to drive change and create solutions.

Attacks can suspend teaching and learning, lead to a significant increase in dropout rates and prevent students from accessing their right to quality education."

Life expectancy at birth now exceeds 75 years in half of the world’s countries, 25 years longer than in 1950. By 2030, older persons are projected to outnumber youth globally, with this increase most rapid in developing countries. This demographic shift has significantly transformed the caregiving landscape, encompassing a wide range of needs for both paid and unpaid support in formal and informal settings. As populations age, the demand for comprehensive healthcare, care, and social support services has grown substantially, particularly for older persons with conditions such as dementia. In recognition of these challenges and opportunities, the 34th commemoration of the United Nations International Day of Older Persons will focus on the theme of “Ageing with Dignity: The Importance of Strengthening Care and Support Systems for Older Persons Worldwide”. This year’s event will bring together experts to discuss policies, legislation, and practices that strengthen care and support systems for older persons. It will highlight the urgent need to expand training and educational opportunities in geriatrics and gerontology, address the global shortage of care workers, and recognize the diverse contributions of caregivers. The commemoration will also emphasize the importance of protecting the human rights of both caregivers and care recipients, promoting person-centered approaches to care that respect the dignity, beliefs, needs, and privacy of older persons, and for the right to make decisions about their care and quality of their lives. – Issued by the United Nations on #InternationalDayofOlderPersons 10 – Oct – 2024",

It is a step forward in their humanitarian journey, steadfastly working to alleviate the interwoven crises that cast shadows on all aspects of life in cities and villages alike.",
          "The organization is sowing seeds of hope and reviving the spirit of life among generations who were on the verge of despair. It is working tirelessly to reconnect fragmented communities by mobilizing the community’s potential and uniting efforts to overcome challenges, contributing to the revitalization of sustainable development, and leaving a legacy full of promise for future generations."

The course spans two weeks, from December 21, 2024, to January 2, 2025, covering various topics, including an introduction to food security-related terms and concepts, characteristics of the targeted households, housing, water, and sanitation data, as well as a focus on food quality, household expenditures, and consumption. The importance of this comprehensive field survey lies in its role as one of the primary references for the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC).

BCFHD organized a consultative workshop targeting 80 participants, including local authorities, community leaders, neighborhood heads, community committees, religious preachers, influential leaders, and civil society organizations. The workshop is part of Targeted Hygiene Promotion Activity Grounded on SBC Models, funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). In his opening remarks, the Secretary-General of Bena Charity, Mr. Tawfiq Abdulkhabeer, emphasized the importance of joint efforts to enhance health awareness and combat epidemics in the most vulnerable communities. He reiterated the association’s commitment to fostering sustainable behavioral change by engaging the community and collaborating with all stakeholders to ensure the project’s objectives are effectively achieved. The workshop featured a presentation of the project’s strategy, including its general and specific objectives, expected outcomes, deliverables, and planned activities, along with their effectiveness in achieving the main goal of reducing the spread of epidemics and diseases related to personal hygiene and water, such as watery diarrhea, cholera, typhoid fever, hepatitis, and other illnesses that burden citizens, particularly in urban neighborhoods, city outskirts, and displacement areas. Dr. Faten Al-Barkani, Deputy Director of the Health Education Department at the provincial health office, praised Bena Charity’s efforts in organizing the workshop. She stressed the importance of strengthening health awareness as a key tool in curbing the spread of epidemics. Furthermore, she highlighted the need to activate partnerships between health entities and the local community to achieve the desired behavioral change and ensure the sustainability of positive outcomes.

The discussions also addressed the integration of roles for stakeholders across various categories, emphasizing the sustainability of efforts to establish healthy behaviors that will ultimately help break the cycle of infection and alleviate the suffering of families and the community as a whole. At the conclusion of the workshop, the Deputy Director of Social Affairs and Labor, Mr. Mahmoud Al-Bakari, expressed his gratitude to Bena Charity for organizing this important event, emphasizing the importance of involving all community groups in the process of health behavior change.

          "BCFHD organized a consultative workshop targeting 80 participants, including local authorities, community leaders, neighborhood heads, community committees, religious preachers, influential leaders, and civil society organizations. The workshop is part of Targeted Hygiene Promotion Activity Grounded on SBC Models, funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).",
          "In his opening remarks, the Secretary-General of Bena Charity, Mr. Tawfiq Abdulkhabeer, emphasized the importance of joint efforts to enhance health awareness and combat epidemics in the most vulnerable communities. He reiterated the association’s commitment to fostering sustainable behavioral change by engaging the community and collaborating with all stakeholders to ensure the project’s objectives are effectively achieved.",
          "The workshop featured a presentation of the project’s strategy, including its general and specific objectives, expected outcomes, deliverables, and planned activities, along with their effectiveness in achieving the main goal of reducing the spread of epidemics and diseases related to personal hygiene and water, such as watery diarrhea, cholera, typhoid fever, hepatitis, and other illnesses that burden citizens, particularly in urban neighborhoods, city outskirts, and displacement areas.",
          "Dr. Faten Al-Barkani, Deputy Director of the Health Education Department at the provincial health office, praised Bena Charity’s efforts in organizing the workshop. She stressed the importance of strengthening health awareness as a key tool in curbing the spread of epidemics. Furthermore, she highlighted the need to activate partnerships between health entities and the local community to achieve the desired behavioral change and ensure the sustainability of positive outcomes.",
          "A significant portion of the workshop was dedicated to group discussions and the exchange of ideas on ensuring active participation of targeted communities. The discussions also addressed the integration of roles for stakeholders across various categories, emphasizing the sustainability of efforts to establish healthy behaviors that will ultimately help break the cycle of infection and alleviate the suffering of families and the community as a whole."

Bena Charity for Human Development (BCFHD) officially handed over the Hob Al-Naqil and Al-Marazem Road Paving Project in Al-Afeera Sub-district, Maqbanah District, to the local authorities today, following the successful completion of the project. The initiative was carried out under the Cash-for-Work activity, as part of the project titled “Building Resilience Through Integrated Community-Based and Humanitarian Systems Transformation and Leadership in Yemen”, funded by the UK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) and implemented in partnership with Oxfam. The project directly benefited 95 families by providing temporary job opportunities through the Cash-for-Work approach, contributing to an improvement in household incomes and enhancing their capacity to cope with economic challenges. In addition to the economic benefits, the project had a positive impact on the local community through the improvement of essential infrastructure. The road works included grading and stone paving over a length of 220 meters with a total paved area of 880 square meters, significantly facilitating the movement of residents, especially in this rugged mountainous area. The Hob Al-Naqil and Al-Marazem Road is considered a vital link between several sub-districts in Maqbanah, serving a large segment of the population, which further amplifies the developmental and social value of the project. During the handover ceremony, project tools were officially handed over to the community committee to be used for future road maintenance or any other community-driven initiatives, under the supervision and oversight of the local authorities. This intervention falls within BCFHD’s broader efforts to support rural communities and strengthen their resilience to economic and living challenges through sustainable development projects that address local needs and create income-generating opportunities to improve livelihoods. The handover event was attended by Mr. Hamid Al-Khalidi, Director of Maqbanah District; Mr. Tawfiq Abdulkhabeer, Secretary-General of BCFHD; Dr. Abdulkarim Al-Sabri, Project Manager; Eng. Zahir Al-Yousifi, Project Officer; as well as members of the community committee, local social figures, and residents from the area.",

By Allah blessings, I was the only candidate from Yemen Republic among the selected group, as there were participants from Asia, Africa, Europe, I studied with. Each group included 25 participants. The program content for this training was” Preparing a project for solving an educational problem” in which the solution should be a part of what we have had through the course and a technological one as well. As I have been a supervisor on the Excellence Centers for both females and males, I had touched a problem of female students’ level of English language, coming from villages to study in university in Taiz, which was weak. The problem was defined and classified accurately under “Delay in Reading Skills”, as its one of the essential matters of any university student for his/her searches, information and references which most of them are written in English language. The idea of the problem solution was to create an educational website in Google in which it includes several educational links and files to improve the language skills, and reading ones in particular which considered a good incentive for self-studying. I chose the village-female student because she didn’t receive any proper attention of training and qualifying in compression to others. I chose the sample of the project to be female students department in the Excellence Center which is provided with a very good infrastructure such as (hall, computer lab, internet…etc) By Allah gracing, 98 % of the project has been adopted and my permission was taken to consider my project as an example for the students of Oregon University. This is to say that the project will be an example referred to from several international countries as this university is ancient and very popular and has a universal fame. Regarding the number of participants in such training courses is about 1200 participants a year, from 125 countries. For this precious occasion, I dedicate my successes for people who have fingerprints in my educational progress, in particular, Mr. Mohammad Ali Esmayel, the ex-chairman of Bena Charity, and Mr. Shawqi Alqadhy, the chairman of Noods Yemen organization whom I have been a very big impact and advantage through. I hope that all students to get an advantage of technology regarding Education, particularly through Internet to gain a very good educational progress as the electronic library has become something indispensable.
